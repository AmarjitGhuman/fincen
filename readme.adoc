[quote, ICIJ again used Neo4j for their investigation]
____
Finally, ICIJ used graph databases (Neo4J and Linkurious) to visualize and explore the FinCEN Filesâ€™ 400 spreadsheets containing data on 100,000 transactions. These were among the many tools to help piece together a nuanced picture of a broken system.

=== Data

https://media.icij.org/uploads/2020/09/download_data_fincen_files.zip[*CSV Files are available for download now*], via: https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/download-fincen-files-transaction-data/

The download contains two CSV files with the same data as our JSON so I'll adjust the instructions below.

The JSON files used here were scraped from their site (https://www.icij.org/investigations/fincen-files/explore-the-fincen-files-data/[Explore The FinCen Data Files])

== Feedback and Contributions

All data is from the ICIJ Web-Visualization (JS files) or download section.

If you have fixes, or new ideas for queries, please send a pull request.

If something doesn't work, please create an issue.


== Pre-Populated Demo Databases

Demo Server with Neo4j Browser

* link:https://demo.neo4jlabs.com:7473/browser?username=fincen&authToken=fincen&database=fincen[demo.neo4jlabs.com] (user:"fincen", password:"fincen", database:"fincen")

Sandbox

* Sandbox: https://10-0-1-92-35670.neo4jsandbox.com/browser/ (user:"fincen", password:"fincen")
* Bloom: https://10-0-1-92-35670.neo4jsandbox.com/browser/bloom/

=== Dump File

* link:fincen.dump[fincen.dump]
* To import into Neo4j Aura, use the "Upload Data" feature and drop the dump file
* For Neo4j Desktop, add the file to your project and use the "Imort Dump" from the 3-dots menu to import
* For manual import use `neo4j-admin load --from fincen.dump` in a stopped dmbs 
* For a running 4.x Enterprise dbms, you need to add `--database fincen` and then use `:use system` and `create database fincen` to activate it.

==  Import into Neo4j

* The scraped JSON files can be imported using link:fincen.cypher[`fincen.cypher`]
* The newly available CSV files can be imported using link:fincen_csv.cypher[`fincen_csv.cypher`]

=== Neo4j Bloom

image::bloom-fincen.png[width=800]

In Neo4j Bloom, you can e.g. search for `Filing Entity` in the search bar.

You can configure the sidebar with icons for Countries, Entities and filings

You can set a rule based styling e.g. for Filings, I did a size based on `amount` with the min `100000` to `0.5x` and the max `100000000` to `2x`

To not have to do that manually, you can also import the link:fincen.neo4j-bloom-perspective[bloom perspective file] in this repository.
